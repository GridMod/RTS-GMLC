# RTS-GMLC
Reliability Test System - Grid Modernization Lab Consortium 

### This repository is for the Reliability Test System Grid Modernization Lab Consortium (RTS-GMLC) which is an updated version of the RTS-96 test system. A summary of updates can be found in [GMLC_updates.md](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC/blob/master/RTS-GMLC_updates.md).
This repository, and the associated data has been developed to facilitate Production Cost Modeling. Reliability calculations using the updated RTS-GMLC data in this repository amd the RTS3 program, provided by [Gene Preston](http:/egpreston.com) can be found [here](http://egpreston.com/NEWRTS.zip).

#### The [RTS_Data](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC/tree/master/RTS_Data) folder contains data in an open `csv` format, and in grid modeling tool specific formats: 

1. [SourceData](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC/tree/master/RTS_Data/SourceData) contains several `csv` files that describe all the RTS-GMLC data.
2. [FormattedData](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC/tree/master/RTS_Data/FormattedData) contains folders for each tool specific data format. Each tool specific folder is also intended to contain a script that automates the conversion from `SourceData` in addition to solutions obtained from each tool in the `FormattedData/*tool*/*tool*_Solution` folder. Currently datasets are included in the following formats:
 - [MATPOWER](http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/)
 - [PowerWorld](https://www.powerworld.com/)
 - [PSS/E](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/products/energy/services/transmission-distribution-smart-grid/consulting-and-planning/pss-software/pss-e.html) v31 and v33
 - [PLEXOS](https://energyexemplar.com/)
 - [Prescient](https://energy.sandia.gov/tag/prescient/)
 - [RTS3](http://egpreston.com/)
 - [pandapower](http://www.pandapower.org)
 - [ANDES](https://github.com/cuihantao/andes)
 - [SIIP](https://github.com/nrel-siip)/[PowerSystems.jl](https://github.com/nrel-siip/PowerSystems.jl)
 - [openTEPES](https://opentepes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## TODO and Identified Areas of Improvement:
 - Conventional Plant Data:
   - Add information about different operating configuration for combined cycle plants
   - Evaluate/address the realism of the relative sizes of units in different categories
 - Wind and Solar Data:
   - Update to the state-of-the-art datasets ([NSRDB](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/) and [WindToolkit](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/wind-toolkit.html)) and add raw weather data
